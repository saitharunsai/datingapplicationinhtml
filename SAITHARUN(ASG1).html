<p1 style="background-color:powderblue;">Jack Ma, or Ma Yun[a] (Chinese: 马云; [mà y̌n]; born 10 September 1964), is a Chinese business magnate, investor and politician. He is the co-founder and former executive chairman of Alibaba Group, a multinational technology conglomerate. Ma is a strong proponent of an open and market-driven economy

Ma is a global ambassador for Chinese business and is often listed as one of the world's most powerful people, with Forbes ranking him 21st on its "World's Most Powerful People" list. He also serves as a role model for startup businesses. In 2017, Ma was ranked second in the annual "World's 50 Greatest Leaders" list by Fortune.

As of April 2020, Ma is the second-wealthiest person in China, with a net worth of $42.1 billion, as well as one of the wealthiest people in the world, ranked 17th by Forbes.
